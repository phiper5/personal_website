    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am a programmer, engineer, scientist, fabricator, and designer with a broad range of interests. My STEM journey started at high school in Texas, with evenings/nights spent programming and developing an understanding of GNU/Linux. I worked part-time through high school and college creating websites and interpreting analytics for a locally owned business. As an undergraduate at Yale, I expanded to electrical and mechanical engineering with a largely hands-on approach through extracurricular projects like the Formula SAE Electric competition. Graduate school at Purdue University allowed me to dive deep into a problem, thus developing a wide set of skills that are applicable across industries. During this time I matured significantly in numerical modeling and simulation applications (fluids, solid mechanics, heat transfer) along with experimental design, fabrication, and testing. Nowadays I work at the Combustion Devices Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory, but I am hoping to transition towards a more impactful career soon!</p>

    <p>On the nontechnical hobby side of life, I spent ~20 years playing competitive soccer through college. Since then I have pivoted to enjoying my free time in nature where possible. In 2019 I was introduced to rock climbing and it has been my go-to sport since. More recently I have picked up surfing, which has become my primary source of salt intake. While on the ground my preferred means of transportation are by foot and bicycle, especially when hills, mountains, plants, forests, and beaches are involved.</p>
