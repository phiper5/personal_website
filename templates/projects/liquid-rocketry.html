    I spent most of my PhD studying carbon deposits in film cooled liquid rocket engines. My arrival at Purdue conveniently coincided with the start of a multiyear program. I was greeted with a completely empty test cell that had just been refloored and a set of program goals promised in my advisor's funded proposal. My first year was spent designing and building <a href="#fluids">fluids</a>, <a href="#structures">structural</a>, and <a href="#electrical">electrical</a> systems to support combustor testing. In parallel, I created a 4&nbsp;MPa heat-sink cooled <a href="#task1">kerosene and hydrogen peroxide combustor</a> to fulfill the requirements set forth in our statement of work. I led buildup, testing, and data analysis while taking on a project manager role for the experimental side of the program. In the latter half of my PhD, I designed a 20&nbsp;MPa water cooled <a href="#task4">kerosene and oxygen combustor</a> to more closely approach the conditions expected in an oxygen-rich staged combustion engine. I was able to complete checkout testing on this higher pressure combustor, but funding ran out before all tests could be finished.

<h2 id="task1">Kerosene and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Combustor</h2>

<p>
The kerosene and hydrogen peroxide combustor (unaffectionately named the "Task&nbsp;1" combustor) was designed to investigate carbon deposits in a film cooled combustor. Most rocket engines use fuel film cooling to keep the metal walls cool from typically greater than 3500&nbsp;K flame temperatures. Kerosene fuels form carbon deposits on the metal chamber walls, which further insulate the walls from hot chamber gases. Most kerosene-based rocket engines use film cooling and account for it in their design, but none account for carbon deposit insulation on the wall, nor try to promote deposition for further insulation. This combustor was designed with a removable annular sample in a heat-sink cooled copper chamber such that the carbonaceous deposits could be analyzed after testing.
</p>

<p>
Flow through the combustor started with 90&nbsp;wt.% hydrogen peroxide injected through a 25&nbsp;mm inner diameter silver-based catalyst bed to decompose the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to approximately 1030&nbsp;K hot oxygen and steam. An orifice plate prevented backflow of carbon-containing combustion products that could be caused by small pressure instabilities in the combustion chamber. After a slight contraction in the chamber diameter, fuel was radially injected through four holes into the hot oxygen and steam flow to promote mixing at a stoichiometric mixture ratio of 7.25. A rearward-facing axisymmetric step further promoted mixing while acting as a flame holder, increasing the internal dimaeter from 20 to 30&nbsp;mm. A thin yttria-stabilized zirconia thermal barrier coating (TBC) protected the flame holder section of the combustor from the high-enthalpy combustion gases, which had temperatures up to 2800&nbsp;K when operated near stoichiometric conditions. Downstream of the step, a fuel film injector introduced a low velocity annular kerosene flow through a thin axisymmetric gap to cool the inner wall of an annular sample chamber liner. The sample length was long enough that phase transition and carbon deposition from the fuel film occurred on the sample. A graphite converging-divergizing nozzle with an 11&nbsp;mm throat diameter choked the flow to achieve chamber pressures up to 5&nbsp;MPa

<p>
The combustor was operated in two modes: monopropellant and bipropellant mode. In monopropellant mode, hydrogen peroxide was injected through the catalyst bed while high pressure nitrogen was purged through the fuel injectors to prevent backflow of hot oxygen. Chamber pressures for monopropellant mode were approximately half those of bipropellant mode. The main fuel and fuel film injector were switched to kerosene during bipropellant mode, which always followed a brief period of monopropellant mode to verify catalyst bed operation. The shutdown procedure consisted of purging nitrogen through the fuel orifices first, followed by hydrogen peroxide shutdown second, all occurring within a few tenths of a second. Total test times were typically capped at around 15&nbsp;seconds, although later testing in a vacuum chamber had test times up to 30&nbsp;seconds.

<p>
The combustor was largely designed for removable sample access, with minimal chamber pressure and hardware temperature measurements. However, fifty thermocouples were added halfway through the test matrix to allow for inverse heat transfer measurements of heat flux, heat transfer coefficient, and carbon deposit properties. The thermocouples were adhered into blind holes within the chamber, with consistent thermal contact resistance achieved at the thermocouple tips. I published a <a href="https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38275">journal paper</a> detailing how this 1D inverse problem could be solved in real time through a method that took advantage of a constant Jacobian matrix.

<h2 id="task4">Kerosene and O<sub>2</sub> Combustor</h2>

<p>
I designed the fuel film oxygen-kerosene carbonaceous deposit combustor (FFOKCDC) to build upon successes of the Task&nbsp;1 combustor while correcting some of its shortcomings. Switching oxidizers from hydrogen peroxide to gaseous oxygen allowed for conditions that more closely approximated those of oxygen-rich staged combustion engines. FFOKCDC was also designed for steady-state operation by using water cooling in the combustion chamber and nozzle. Water cooling designs often suffer from thermal expansion failures, especially with such thin chamber liners, which was addressed through a graphite gasket thermal expansion joint at the nozzle. I integrated oxidizer flow control via a sonic venturi inbetween the igniter and combustion chamber to enhance axisymmetry for model validation. The use of gaseous oxygen instead of hydrogen peroxide required an igniter, which I designed based on Zucrow heritage igniters with a few key improvements:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Adjustable spark gap set screw with compression retainer</li>
    <li>Hydrogen injection at the spark point to ensure ignitable mixture</li>
    <li>Use of low-cost Auburn furnace igniters</li>
</ul>

    {% include "image_1.html" %}
{% endwith %}

<p>
The requirement for an axisymmetric flow domain drove the design of FFOKCDC. The principle design feature was that the igniter nozzle also acted as the oxygen sonic venturi used for mass flow rate measurements. Thus, the oxygen could be introduced in an axisymmetric manner with the Mach&nbsp;1 throat acting as a CFD boundary condition. The startup transient for FFOKCDC began with oxygen-rich ignition in the igniter, quickly followed by hydrogen-rich ignition in the main combustion chamber. Hydrogen in the igniter was turned off and then the oxygen flow was ramped up until the main combustion chamber was burning an oxygen-rich mixture at the nominal oxidizer mass flow rate. Lastly, hydrogen in the main injector was switched to kerosene at a nominal mixture ratio of around 2.3 (depended on the chamber pressure). The main injector was a shear coaxial element with oxygen on the inside and fuel in the outer annulus. Water film coolant was injected just upstream of the main nozzle to ensure its integrity.

<h2 id="fluids">Fluid Systems</h2>

<p>
I was fortunate to have the experience of designing hydrogen, oxygen, kerosene, and hydrogen peroxide propellant systems during my time at Purdue. Most of these systems operated at pressures up to 40&nbsp;MPa with flow rates of around 0.5&nbsp;kg/s. I also designed high pressure nitrogen pressurization systems for the liquid propellants and purges for every propellant feed system. The fluid system buildup took place in two iterations, with the first one focusing on high pressure kerosene and hydrogen peroxide systems. Hydrogen and oxygen systems were added for the FFOKCDC igniter. FFOKCDC also required water cooling, so I built a 6&nbsp;MPa, 10&nbsp;kg/s water feed system. Some representative process and instrumentation diagrams (P&amp;IDs) are shown below.

    {% include "image_3.html" %}
{% endwith %}

<p>
Most of the feed system buildup fell on my shoulders, since graduate student labor is considered fairly cheap. I had lab engineer oversight, graduate student design help, and undergraduate build help throughout my four years with Purdue, all of which enabled project success. I have become more than familiar with flow devices, process design, and construction practices since I had four years to get all of my fabrication mistakes out of the way.

<h2 id="structures">Structure</h2>

<p>
I was fortunate to find two 60&nbsp;MPa stainless steel tanks in a back shed at Purdue that could be used as kerosene and hydrogen peroxide propellant tanks. I designed and built a tank stand to house them. At 150&nbsp;kg each they were more than difficult to raise into place; there's a story for how that happened in a test cell with no forklift  or engine hoist access. Now in place, the tank stand acts as the main structure for propellant feed system installation within the test cell, and has serviced over 10 different projects within a few years of operation, with plenty more projects to come!

<h2 id="electrical">Electronics/Control</h2>

<p>
The data acquisition and control system for the test cell was largely in place from previous testing. It used a series of National Instruments SCXI chassis with valve, pressure transducer, and thermocouple circuits patched into a test cell junction box. I expanded the number of thermocouples by 64 to accomodate inverse heat transfer measurements and improved the control system to include hardware timing for autosequence and redline controls. The LabVIEW code consisted of a Zucrow-based program which enabled rapid control, acquisition, and front panel buildup. The example front panel below could be created (frontend, backend, autosequence, and redlines) by an experienced engineer in less than 4&nbsp;hours despite having 10s of pneumatic valves, pressure transducers, thermocouples, and a load cell.
