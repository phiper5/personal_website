    Formula SAE is an international competition where student teams design, fabricate, and race cars to a set of rules called the formula. Bulldogs Racing is Yale University's chapter of Formula SAE, which has competed in some form of the competition since 2007. During my first year with the team we competed at the Formula SAE Hybrid competition, taking 3rd place in 2014. We converted to an all-electric team for my last year and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
    From 2015-2016 I was Chief Engineer of the team, during which time I led design and fabrication of the suspension, steering, brakes, and chassis portions of the car. My approach for vehicle dynamics design started at the <a href="#tires">tires</a>, then worked through <a href="#suspension">suspension</a> and <a href="#chassis">chassis</a>, and finished with <a href="#steering">steering</a> and <a href="#brakes">brakes</a>.

<h2 id="tires">Tires</h2>

<p>
Most of the forces exerted on and by a racecar go through the tires, as they are the only contact points between the vehicle and the ground. Additionally, Formula SAE specifies average speeds of 25 to 30 mph, which suggests limited aerodynamic forces on the car since downforce and drag force vary with velocity squared. Tire selection is crucial to vehicle performance and defines the rest of vehicle dynamics design. I would highly suggest <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Racing_High_performance_Tire.html?id=oAbg-tWC4uAC">The Racing &amp; High-Performance Tire: Using Tires to Tune for Grip &amp; Balance</a> by Paul Haney; it greatly influenced my understanding of and approach to tire analysis.
</p>

<p>
The Formula SAE Tire Test Consortium pools resources from teams to obtain high quality tire force and moment data for a selection of relevant tires. From this data, tire coefficients of friction can be fit for a variety of pressures, vertical loads, cambers, and slip angles to then determine the perfect tire fit for a given vehicle design. I completed the tire data analysis for Bulldogs Racing and determined that 6 inch wide front and 7.5 inch wide rear Hoosier tires offered the optimal performance for our projected 300 lb, 60% rear-weight biased car. A 0&#176; camber resulted in the highest coefficient of friction for the Hoosier tires, which was a primary input into the suspension design. Example raw tire data are shown below, with coefficient of friction (normalized Y force minus one) dependent on slip angle between the tire and direction of travel.

<h2 id="suspension">Suspension</h2>

<p>
The vehicle suspension system translates forces from the tires to the chassis, ideally while keeping the tire's in their optimum orientation. A double wishbone suspension geometry allows for independent wheel movement through well-defined camber and tire load changes in bump, droop, and roll. I designed the Bulldogs Racing 2016 suspension to optimize tire performance while allowing for independent adjustment of ride height, toe, and camber. Ideally this would have involved a track simulation software, but limited design man-hours forced our team to focus on optimizing the suspension based on tire data and a roll analysis while falling within the formula constraints.
</p>

<p>
Selecting a working tire camber range started at the tires, and was carried out independently for the front 6” Hoosiers and the rear 7.5” Hoosiers. The peak coefficient of friction values were first averaged across tire pressure and camber to determine optimal rim width. Then that rim width was set as a constant and the peak values were averaged across only camber to find optimal tire pressure, which was unsurprisingly the lowest tire pressure in the dataset due to the larger contact patch size of a flatter tire (up to the point of debeading). Lastly, the chosen rim width and pressure were set constant while the peak coefficient of friction values were varied against vertical load for various cambers. Tire performance vs. camber curves are shown below, as well as a closeup of the installed double wishbone suspension.

<p>
My approach to suspension design had three major steps: 1. Start with 2D dynamic wishbone geometry design to determine camber and roll center change in bump, droop, and roll; 2. Progress to a 3D geometry with 2D sketches for the pull rod - rocker - spring/damper plane as informed by spring travel requirements; 3. Finalize the 3D suspension rod, rocker, and spring/damper mount points via a load analysis.
</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>2D Wishbone Sketches: </b>As I mentioned in the <a href="#tires">Tires</a> section, the Hoosier tires operated optimally at a 0&#176; camber. A second input parameter to this design was the formula requirement for 1 inch of suspension travel in either direction. This was increased to 1.25 inches in each direction for 2.5 inches total to insure that the design complied with the formula. Upright pickup points were determined by track width and wheelwell room. With these requirements in place, a compromise between front/rear roll center heights and camber changes in roll resulted in a design with approximately 2&#176; of camber change for 2.5&#176; of roll. The static camber was 0.5&#176; and 1&#176; in the front and rear respectively because the uprights had built-in camber adjustment in the positive direction only via shims. This design kept the front and rear roll centers as close as possible to each other in both height and lateral offset such that the roll axis remained constant relative to the vehicle mass centroid axis.</li>
    <li><b>3D Wishbone / 2D Pull-Rod Sketches: </b>With the 2D front and rear wishbone geometries defined, I could transition to a 3D sketch that included longitudinal chassis pickup points and a 2D dynamic sketch plane for pull-rod, rocker, and spring/damper design. Pull rods were used to locate the spring/damper system low on the chassis, thus helping to lower the vehicle center of gravity. The spring/damper system for the front was located between chassis nodes such that suspension forces could be effectively transmitted to the tube frame structure. Main goals for this 2D model were to determine spring/damper and rocker locations, determine rocker motion ratio to transmit suspension travel to spring travel, and begin interference checks before 3D parts were modeled.</li>
    <li><b>Full 3D Design: </b>I started the full 3D design by taking the 3D wishbone and 2D pull-rod sketches and propogating geometry into force calculations, thus allowing for tube, rocker, and spring/damper sizing. Inboard and outboard pull-rod ends were right and left hand threaded respectively to allow for ride height adjustment. The rocker was a simple welded steel design with a brass bushing. Spring/damper systems were purchased off the shelf, with multiple spring options to allow for ride stiffness adjustments. The primary goals achieved via this design approach were correct sizing of components with appropriate safety factors and preventing unintended interference through the suspension's normal travel.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The uprights are a crucial connecting point between wheels, suspension, steering, and brakes. I designed both the front and rear uprights with high stiffness per mass and adjustability in mind. A removable plate was added at the bottom A-arm attachment point to allow for static camber adjustment. The front camber plate also included the steering arm so that adjusting camber did not require a steering rod length adjustment, thus making bump steer independent of camber adjustment. A set of two steering plates attached to the front upright's camber plate allowed for adjustment of bump steer and Ackermann independently of camber. Additionally, the rear upright upper A-arm attachment point was moved off center to accommodate a larger toe base. This reduced loads and compliance through the toe rod giving the driver better control over the vehicle. Finite element analysis was used to maximize stiffness while minimizing upright mass. Representative vehicle loads were used with maximum strain constraints to optimize the upright design. I machined the front uprights on a CNC mill at Yale and the rear uprights were machined by Sikorsky as an in-kind donation.

<h2 id="steering">Steering</h2>

<p>
The typical Formula SAE steering design uses a rack and pinion connected through two steering rods to the uprights. The rack is connected through a column and universal joint to the steering wheel. The ratio of the rack and pinion along with the upright attachment location relative to its steering rotation axis determines the total steering ratio of the vehicle. This ratio determines how much a turn of the steering wheel affects turning of the front wheels. A typical set point is 180 degrees of steering wheel travel for 30 degrees of inside wheel travel. This along with the steering wheel diameter determines the force exerted by the driver during peak cornering accelerations. Steering ratio and torque at the steering wheel are inversely proportional with each other, resulting in a trade off between degrees of wheel travel and driver exertion.
</p>

<p>
I started the steering design by fixing driver torque at the steering wheel and determining steering ratio from tire angle requirements. Once the ratio and forces were sorted, a two dimensional top view model of the vehicle steering was used to determine Ackermann geometry, which is used to allow the inside wheel to turn more than the outer one, thus reducing tire scrub in tight corners. The steering rack was placed forward of the upright steering link to enable a progressive Ackermann geometry, creating little steering angle difference in low angle corners and large wheel angle differences in tight, slow corners. This geometry is ideal for Formula SAE as it allows for less scrub during sharp turns while still giving good turn-in performance for larger radius corners. Additionally it has the added benefit of making the vehicle easy to move around the paddock by limiting tire scrub during sharp turns. Once the 2D model was completed, the geometry could be translated to three dimensions to determine chassis mounting points and interferences. Additionally the 3D model allowed for integration with the suspension model at the upright.

<h2 id="brakes">Brakes</h2>

<p>
I designed the brakes around peak coefficient of friction for the tires and the assumed 60% vehicle rear weight bias. A maximum deceleration of 2g was used since the brake system needs to be overdesigned to ensure tire locking at all velocities. The front and rear coefficients of frictions were calculated in the <a href="#tires">Tires</a> section. Then these forces were matched by those exerted through the hydraulic brake lines. The master cylinders actuated by the drivers foot and the brake calipers that actuate the brake discs on the wheel hub had pistons that interacted with the hydraulic brake lines. The ratio of these pistons' areas determined the force for a particular brake caliper. Since the front and rear brakes were on different brake lines, each line could be run at a different pressure such that more force was exerted in the front than the rear.
</p>

<p>
Wilwood cylinders and calipers were used as they were cheap, easy to source, and came in a variety of piston diameters. It was found that an 11/16” front master cylinder diameter and 9/8” rear master cylinder diameter along with 9/8” front and rear brake caliper diameters resulted in a well-balanced car. This sizing had the added benefit of locking the front tires before the rears, thus putting the car in a stable understeer scenario should only one pair of tires lock. Had the opposite been true with the rears locking before the fronts, the car would tend to skid leaving the driver with little to no control over the direction that the car is traveling. In parallel to determining these numbers, the front uprights were developed to accommodate the Wilwood brake calipers. These calipers were preferentially placed towards the front of the upright to lessen the load on the upright bearings whenever braking occurred, rather than adding to the already 1g loading from gravity.

<h2 id="chassis">Chassis</h2>

<p>
Chassis design occurred in parallel with suspension, steering, and brakes design since the chassis needed to transmit all loads from these subsystems to the rest of the vehicle. Additionally, the formula had strict rules concerning chassis materials and design for safety reasons. On top of those requirements, the chassis needed to fit various other subsystems such as the powertrain, battery box, pedal box, seat/driver, and cooling. Due to long fabrication lead times, the chassis had to be oversized and manufactured early in the design cycle while other subsystem designs were still in progress.
