    In spring of 2018 I led a <a href="#team">team</a> of 9 students that built a 100&nbsp;ft propane flame effect called Big Friendly Flame (BFF) as part of Purdue's AAE&nbsp;535 Propulsion Design, Build, Test class. Professor Carson Slabaugh and Dr. Rohan Gejji taught the class while funding was provided by a large Burning Man camp. My contributions ranged from project management to detailed engineering design. Additionally, I committed my summer of 2018 to delivering the flame effect for Burning Man 2018 (end of August), even after the class was completed.
    </p>
    <p>
    I structured our semester into a two-step approach: quickly test a <a href="#preliminary-design">preliminary design</a> then plan and build a final <a href="#deliverable-design">deliverable design</a>. The difficulty of multiphase turbulent combustion modeling prompted this approach, as well as the limited time in a semester. Both the preliminary design and deliverable design successfully produced over 100&nbsp;ft flames, the latter of which could operate in the isolated Black Rock desert, where <a href="#burningman">Burning Man 2018</a> took place.

<h2 id="preliminary-design">Preliminary Design</h2>

<p>
My approach to the problem of building a 100&nbsp;ft propane flame relied heavily on experimentation due to the difficulties in modeling a transient multiphase turbulent flame. Zucrow Laboratories at Purdue University was the ideal site for testing because most of the hardware we needed was already available. The team spent approximately $650 total on preliminary testing, most of which was commercial propane and compressed nitrogen. A small test stand was constructed for the gaseous propane pilot flame and igniter to measure pilot blowout resistance, igniter flame length, and igniter consistency. With the igniter functioning, we moved on to water testing to validate our pressurized liquid ejection empirical height predictions. A few tests were completed with self-pressurized gaseous propane to prove that the 100&nbsp;ft flame height could not be achieved without significant increases in fluid hardware sizing. The majority of preliminary design testing involved measurement of liquid propane flame heights.
</p>

{% endwith %}

<p>
Liquid column height scales sublinearly with mass flow rate without taking into account flame buoyancy effects. The flame effect was designed with a nitrogen pressurization scheme because mass flow rate scales with the square root of pressure drop. Propane self pressurization varies with ambient temperature (5 to 13&nbsp;bar), whereas a consistent 25+&nbsp;bar was achievable with nitrogen. Flow resistance was minimized in the ejection fluid pathway by using 1&nbsp;inch tubing and a large propane accumulator exit port. Liquid propane had to be transferred from DOT storage containers to the accumulator by distillation, with an electric heater on the storage tank, since a pump was not available. This process took 10s of minutes and turned out to be a hassle since liquid level gauging was not implemented. Furthermore, the ejector design required a portion of the accumulator to remain as headspace since the nitrogen fluid system was undersized. With time, we were able to "operate" away this difficulty due to familiarity with the system. However, the team decided to opt for a propane pump in the deliverable design.

{% endwith %}

<p>
The ignition system consisted of a gaseous propane pilot flame and igniter jet. The always-on pilot needed to be unextinguishable in a wide variety of ambient and operating conditions. The igniter jet needed to be consistently lit by the pilot and needed to consistently light the ejector, which had a mass flow rate 3-4 orders of magnitude larger than the ignition system. Preliminary igniter testing varied the distance between pilot and igniter, distance between pilot and ejector, igniter mass flow rate, and pilot light geometry/materials. Igniter testing uncovered the following findings:
<ol>
    <li>
        The pilot light must be located more than 11&nbsp;cm away from the igniter torch to prevent it from extinguishing by a venturi effect.
    </li>
    <li>
        The pilot light must be located at least 30&nbsp;cm away from the main ejector to prevent it from extinguishing by a venturi effect.
    </li>
    <li>
        Steel wool was effective at preventing the pilot light from extinguishing due to high winds.
    </li>
    <li>
        A ring-shaped pilot light reliably lit the igniter torch in high wind conditions whereas a single-point diffusion pilot flame did not.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the igniter torch failed, the pilot light was sufficient to light the ejector (albeit with a delay) thus acting as a fail-safe.
    </li>
</ol>

{% endwith %}

<p>
Water testing allowed for verification of the preliminary design using inert fluids: nitrogen and water. Mass flow rate, nozzle diameter, and wind effects on water column height were checked against our empirical models. We found that the ejector operated best without a nozzle flow restriction because larger water mass flow rates delayed jet breakup into fine droplets. Testing with gaseous propane was limited by the vapor pressure of propane and ejector system sizing. Flames up to 17&nbsp;ft were achieved, as measured by a camera and reference height through some basic trigonometry. With empirical models, we concluded that a fluid system sizing greater than 3&nbsp;inches in internal diameter would be required to achieve a 100&nbsp;ft gaseous propane flame. A gaseous ejector design would also require a custom ASME gaseous propane tank (with a 3&nbsp;inch port) and would suffer from ambient cooling as well as evaporation cooling limiting ejection pressures.

    {% include "image_2.html" %}
{% endwith %}

<p>
Most of the preliminary design testing focused on liquid propane pressurized by a nitrogen ullage, with pressures up to 33&nbsp;bar. We measured flame heights over 100&nbsp;ft using mass flow rates up to 7.5&nbsp;kg/s. For a given fluid system size, liquid propane ejection resulted in much higher flame heights than those from gaseous propane ejection due to the liquid's higher density, and therefore mass flow rate. Ejection velocity increases caused by a restricting nozzle reduced flame height since temperature-driven buoyancy effects dominated the fireball convection flow. Wind speed had the second largest effect on flame height since it prematurely mixed the buoyancy-driven flow. Additionally, tests longer than 1-2&nbsp;seconds reached a peak height upon ejection which rapidly tapered as the nitrogen pressure dropped from the preliminary design's blowdown operation. From these tests, we concluded that a 1&nbsp;inch tube liquid propane ejector with 25&nbsp;bar of nitrogen ullage would be sufficient to consistently achieve 100&nbsp;ft flames, even in moderately windy conditions.

{% endwith %}

<p>
Since propane's vapor pressure is above atmospheric, we expected two-phase flow phenomena upon liquid propane ejection. Our ejector design ensured a vapor quality of 0% throughout the ejector tube to prevent two-phase flow choking from limiting mass flow rate. A large pressure drop across the ejection nozzle reduced the fluid to atmospheric pressure, thus causing partial evaporation and expansion of the flow. Larger vapor fractions occurred at higher temperatures due to propane's saturation pressure curve with temperature. And larger vapor fractions resulted in higher boundary layer mixing with ambient air, thus combusting more propane earlier, and reducing total flame height. We concluded that subcooling of the liquid propane before ejection through evaporation cooling would result in higher flame effect heights.

{% endwith %}

<p>
We did not expect a smoke ring phenomenon to occur from the flame effect's operation. A previous Purdue-designed flame effect called the Combustible Vortex Ring Generator (CVRG) was created specifically for large-scale flame/smoke ring generation in 2013. We accidentally replicated CVRG's effect on a much larger scale! A cold and dense propane multiphase liquid droplet core encountered drag which reduced it's velocity as it gained height. Conversely, the hot and light combusted propane/air mixture at the boundary layer rose quickly due to buoyancy. A large-scale vortex formed as the hot buoyant gas recirculated through the core and produced combustion soot. Vortex ring stability and the combustion-generated soot resulted in a 40&nbsp;ft diameter rising smoke ring that lasted up to 10&nbsp;minutes post-ejection. High wind speeds prevented vortex formation and moderate winds prematurely pinched off the vortex.

<h2 id="deliverable-design">Deliverable Design</h2>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xl-6">
    <p>
    The preliminary design verified that a 100&nbsp;ft flame could be produced by a liquid propane ejector pressurized with gaseous nitrogen. However, the deliverable design required significantly more design effort such that it was compact enough for mounting on a fire truck and simple enough to be used by non-engineer operators. In addition to propane and nitrogen fluid systems, the deliverable design had structural and electrical design elements that were not necessary in the preliminary design. All components had to be sourced in a short time period since the final product would be shipped to our sponsor by late summer, and to Burning Man in the middle of August. I spent a large portion of my 2018 summer welding the stand, wiring the electronics, building the fluid systems, and testing the finished product. The following requirements were developed to guide the deliverable design:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Develop a flame effect with an 80-100&nbsp;ft height.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use propane and air as the fuel and oxidizer respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
            The flame effect must be operable on a vehicle and standalone.
        </li>
        <li>
            Conform the fuel system to NFPA codes 54, 58, and 160.
        </li>
        <li>
            Control the flame effect with an on/off digital signal.
        </li>
        <li>
            Power the flame effect with a 120&nbsp;V AC source.
        </li>
        <li>
            The flame effect must be operable from 14°F to 113°F.
        </li>
        <li>
            System components must be accessible for replacement and repair.
        </li>
        <li>
            The max sound exposure must be less than 120&nbsp;dBA from 15&nbsp;ft away.
        </li>
    </ol>

<h3>Fluid Systems</h3>

<p>
The deliverable design process and instrumentation diagram (P&amp;ID) largely matched that of the preliminary design. Two identical ASME pressure vessels rated to 40&nbsp;bar were connected through a high flow valve; one was for liquid propane and the other for gaseous nitrogen. This design allowed for sufficient nitrogen headspace and reduced nitrogen waste between fillings and firings, which was crucial to desert operation where we would have to bring our own 400&nbsp;bar pressurized nitrogen cylinders. A liquid propane pump designed for use on LPG delivery trucks simplified and quickened the filling procedure. Five 100&nbsp;lb liquid propane tanks were manifolded together in order to provide sufficient mass flow to prevent stalling of the pump. A smaller 60 lb propane tank supplied gaseous propane for the ignition system. Pneumatic valves were operated off of the same high pressure nitrogen cylinder as the ejection system, albeit through a 6&nbsp;bar pressure regulator. Pressure transducers monitored various relevant system pressures for redline conditions. The vent and relief valve systems were sized for a worst-case scenario high pressure nitrogen regulator failure in the open condition. Procedures were developed for air dilution in the propane accumulator using nitrogen such that a combustible mixture would never be present.

    {% include "image_1.html" %}
{% endwith %}

<p>
An incompressible 1D fluid analysis was used to calculate liquid ejection, gaseous ullage, pump fill, and nitrogen fill mass flow rates. We found that 11&nbsp;kg/s liquid propane could be ejected with a propane  accumulator pressure of 35&nbsp;bar. The nitrogen mass flow rate would be 0.9&nbsp;kg/s at this condition, and the pressure drop between accumulators would be less than 3&nbsp;bar. Propane fill time using the LPG pump was most dependent on the 100&nbsp;lb propane tank valve flow coefficient. We approximated a propane fill time of 82&nbsp;seconds with five tanks in parallel assuming a valve flow coefficient of 0.7. Nitrogen fill time was considerably shorter, approximately 11&nbsp;seconds, since a high flow regulator was used on the nitrogen cylinder. Given these parameters and taking into account vent times, the BFF system could ideally be recycled in less than 2&nbsp;minutes. Additionally, the propane accumulator was large enough for multiple back-to-back firings on one liquid propane filling.

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>
All components for BFF were mounted to a mild steel frame except for the LPG pump and storage tanks. The high pressure nitrogen cylinder could be mounted on or off of the stand. All external fluid connections were located in one corner of the stand and all electrical connections merged into a single junction box. Finite element analysis confirmed the need for ejector tube support due to the momentum of ejecting 11&nbsp;kg/s of propane despite the small moment arm from the main run valve to the ejection point. A nitrogen cylinder support plate also required analysis to minimize deflection caused by up to 150&nbsp;kg of gas cylinder weight. The stand measured 60x120x120&nbsp;cm in dimension and I welded the mild steel stand at Purdue's Bechtel Innovation Design Center to reduce project spending costs.

    {% include "image_2.html" %}
{% endwith %}

<h3>Electronics/Control</h3>

<p>
The electronics and control system contains power distribution, safety interlock, and feedback/control circuitry all used to safely operate BFF. I designed and built the wiring diagram and enclosure which contained an AC/DC power supply, Ruggeduino microcontroller, thermocouple signal conditioner, 24 VDC relay DIN module, and two relay DIN modules all housed in a NEMA 3R enclosure on a single 10&nbsp;inch DIN rail. The 110&nbsp;VAC to 24&nbsp;VDC, 10&nbsp;A AC/DC converter supplied power to the entire system. A Ruggeduino microcontroller read instrumentation, actuated valves, and responded to user input. The thermocouple signal conditioner converted liquid fill level thermocouple milliVolt output to a 0-5&nbsp;V signal readable by the Ruggeduino analog-to-digital converter. A 24&nbsp;VDC relay DIN module powered the individual valve relays, with N-MOSFET circuitry to power each coil from the Ruggeduino. The two relay DIN modules housed three individual valve relays each, for a total of six valve relays. All system power was routed through an emergency stop button on the user control panel and on the BFF stand.

{% endwith %}

<p>
The handheld user controller consisted of arm, vent, fill, and pressurize toggle switches. Software control logic verified user inputs before valve actuation to maintain a safe system at all times. An igniter button could be used to test the gaseous propane igniter before running the main autosequence, which was actuated through the ejector button. Two potentiometers could be used to control accumulator pressure and igniter delay within software-verified safe bounds. LEDs displayed power and pressure feedback. And most importantly, a large E-stop button was displayed prominently for shutting down the entire system (through hardware, not software), thus returning all valves to their safe state. Although never fully implemented, a DMX connector was added to the handheld enclosure for synchronization/timing autosequences with music. Overall, these user inputs/outputs allowed for control over the flame effect without overcomplication, and without compromising safety.

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>
The completed deliverable design was tested at Purdue's Zucrow Labs during the summer of 2018 to verify performance before shipment to our sponsor. Most testing was completed in three days and the flame effect operated similarly to the preliminary design. A final test was complted in July to fully shakedown the filling/venting/firing procedures and electronics/control scheme. Overall, BFF performed as expected when tested at Purdue and we were able to ship the flame effect on time for integration at our sponsor's facility and operation at Burning Man 2018!

<h2 id="burningman">Burning Man 2018</h2>

<p>
The deliverable design of BFF was crated and shipped to our sponsor in July 2018 along with a four page set of notes for assembly, integration, operations, and upgrades. The sponsor's fire team, including some of our Purdue team, handled operations while at Burning Man. Filling, venting, and safing were largely done by the fire team, but ignition and ejection were shared among the crowds of interested passerbys while on the playa. It was truly an awesome experience to see this flame effect from design on a whiteboard to operation on desert nights. I can't thank our sponsor (who remain unnamed for privacy) enough for their support and trust in our team!

<h2 id="team">The Team</h2>

<p>
I had the privilege of leading an incredible team of graduate and undergraduate students. Hasan, Blair, Tristan, Mark, Naveen, Steven, Angel, and Brandon did an amazing job throughout the semester. Some of the team even contributed over the summer, helping to see through final fabrication, testing, and delivery of the flame effect. Professor Slabaugh and Dr. Gejji contributed immensely to this project, always guiding us towards the path of reason as our imaginations ran wild. Alicia, Jason, and Ben had worked on previous flame effects while students at Purdue, and all three of them were extremely helpful throughout the project. Lastly, our sponsor organization and their awesome team of designers, creators, engineers, and friends made this project possible. Thank you so much to everyone that helped turn Big Friendly Flame from idea to reality!
