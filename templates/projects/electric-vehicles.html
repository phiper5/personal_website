    Formula SAE is an international competition where student teams design, fabricate, and race cars to a set of rules called the formula. Bulldogs Racing is Yale University's chapter of Formula SAE, which has competed in some form of the competition since 2007. During my first year with the team we competed at the Formula SAE Hybrid competition, taking 3rd place in 2014. We converted to an all-electric team for my last year and a half.

    From 2015-2016 I was Chief Engineer of the <a href="#team">team</a>, during which time I led design and fabrication of the <a href="#battery-box">battery box</a>, <a href="#high-voltage">high voltage</a>, and <a href="#low-voltage">low voltage</a> systems of the vehicle. I also led the high-level <a href="#powertrain">powertrain</a> system design including motor, inverter, and battery cell selection. These systems largely defined the vehicle acceleration and efficiency performance.

<h2 id="powertrain">Powertrain</h2>

<p>
A system-level design of the vehicle's powertrain required strict adherence to the formula and performance-price trade-offs between commercial-off-the-shelf battery cells, motor inverters, and motors. Many commercial electric vehicles use DC-DC converters to step-up low battery pack voltages, thus reducing I<sup>2</sup>R losses. This practice decreases the number of cells in series and mitigates battery pack energy losses due to cell mismatch and degradation. However, the formula stipulated a maximum tractive system voltage of 300&nbsp;V, which was low enough for me to rule out DC-DC conversion early on in the design process. The formula also restricted maximum power output to 80&nbsp;kW and energy storage to 5.4&nbsp;kWh with an 80% cell derating, which influenced motor and cell selection respectively. The high power-to-weight ratio of electric motors enabled an independent rear wheel drive design with two Emrax 207 motors delivering up to 160&nbsp;Nm at 320&nbsp;A each. Driving the rear wheels with separate motors precluded the need for a differential and chain/gear drive while also reducing axle lengths. The motors were selected to complement a 300&nbsp;V tractive system voltage and 4:1 planetary gearboxes matched the Emrax 207 speed/torque outputs to those necessary for Formula SAE acceleration and autocross events.

<p>
Formula SAE has three dynamic events: acceleration, autocross, and endurance. The design described thus far was optimized for acceleration and autocross, while still offering adequate endurance performance. Rear tire coefficient of friction, weight balance, and pitch axis were used to calculate a peak acceleration of 1.3g. The motors and batteries were sized large enough to burn out the rear wheels at speeds up to 40&nbsp;mph. Prediction for straight-line 0-60&nbsp;mph were 2.09&nbsp;s and the powertrain was sized for a maximum speed of 90&nbsp;mph, which was high enough to cover peak acceleration event speeds with some safety factor.
</p>


<h2 id="battery-box">Battery Box</h2>

<p>
Battery cell selection was performed in parallel with motor and motor controller selection. The formula limited bus voltage to 300&nbsp;V, power output to 80&nbsp;kW, and battery energy to 5.4&nbsp;kWh. Several cylindrical, prismatic, and pouch cell systems were traded based largely on performance, complexity, and cost. Lithium cobalt oxide cells had the best specific energies, but there were serious concerns about cell puncture and thermal runaway safety at the time, especially given that this was a student team operating at a university. The lithium iron phosphate chemistry offered higher specific power and safety at the cost of specific energy. Power-energy requirements for the competition's dynamic events encouraged my decision to use a lithium iron phosphate chemistry, which also took into account safety concerns. Note that most commercial electric vehicles have power-energy requirements that prefer high specific energy, thus pointing towards a lithium cobalt oxide chemistry, or more recently a lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide chemistry. Additionally, puncture and thermal runaway safety performance for these chemistries have been greatly improved throughout the late 2010s.
</p>

<p>
A123 Systems, a spin-off of MIT, was the premier provider of lithium iron phosphate battery cells at the time. Their AMP20 pouch cell with a 3.3&nbsp;V nominal voltage, 19.5&nbsp;Ah capacity, 10C continuous current rating, and 22C peak (for 10&nbsp;s) current rating was perfectly sized for our vehicle. The high cell capacity meant that all cells could be placed in series, thus circumventing individual cell string fusing requirements in the formula. I designed a battery box with 86 of these cells in two stacks of 21 cells and two stacks of 22 cells to limit voltages for assembly and handling. Formula rules limited battery segments to maximums of 15&nbsp;kg, 120&nbsp;V, and 1.67&nbsp;kWh. The theoretical maximum voltage of the battery (with 3.6&nbsp;V max per cell) was 310&nbsp;V, but charging was limited to 300&nbsp;V to follow the formula and allow for cell inhomogeneities. Overall, the battery pack could supply high enough currents to nearly saturate the two Emrax 207 motors while still allowing for high speed operation at a peak voltage near 300&nbsp;V.

<p>
The formula specified additional rules for the use of lithium ion cells in the battery pack. At least 30% of cells were required to be monitored by the battery management system (BMS) for both voltage and temperature. Due to the large cell size and limited number of cells, I designed the BMS to monitor all 86 cell voltages and temperatures. Distributed cell boards were placed between the tabs of each cell and a two wire protocol was used to communicate between cell boards and the centralized BMS controller, an eLithion Lithiumate Pro. The cell board location had two benefits: easy access to positive and negative terminals as well as optimal placement for temperature monitoring, since cell tabs have limited areas (high current density) with high internal resistances. The BMS was sophisticated enough to prevent overcharging, overdischarging, and overheating while estimating battery pack voltage and energy in real-time.
</p>

<p>
The formula also had rules for pouch-style cells with laminated aluminum casings that expanded and contracted during operation. To prevent the cells from delaminating, an expansion limiter pressed the cells together, face-to-face, with a nearly constant pressure throughout the cells' operating life. A123 suggested containing the cells at between 0.3 and 1.2&nbsp;bar with cycle life peaking at a cell pressure of 0.8&nbsp;bar. A polyurethane filler, aluminum end plates, and steel threaded rods limited cell expansion to meet this requirement. As the cells expanded, the filler was compressed, thus reducing the pressure rise. Aluminum end plates transmitted the threaded rod tension evenly across the cell faces, as verified by finite element analysis.

<p>
Cells were individually tested for capacity and internal resistance via a custom testing circuit that could operate at currents of 0.5C or 1C (10&nbsp;A or 20&nbsp;A). A Beaglebone Black controlled the circuit by relay in an automated test cycle based on cell voltage. Current was measured via a 0.005&nbsp;&ohm; shunt resistor and precision op amp. After all cells were tested, they were distributed between battery stacks based on measured cell capacity. In this manner the stacks could be individually charged before the endurance event to maximize total battery charge. The battery box could also be charged as a whole at the cost of less total charge. Multiple cells were rejected due to significantly lower capacity, thus proving that individual cell testing was worthwhile. Battery stacks were also tested for voltage, capacity, and temperature at multiple current setpoints with large power resistors to validate performance at the stack level.
</p>

<p>
The formula had strict guidelines for materials used within the battery box, all of which had to be UL&nbsp;94&nbsp;V-0 rated (or equivalent). Stratasys RGD525 plastic material was used to 3D print battery stack tab covers on an Objet30 Pro. Specimens of this material were also printed to carry out testing for dielectric strength (ASTM D149 IEC 60243) and fire resistance (UL&nbsp;94&nbsp;V-0). Rogers Corporation PORON&reg; foam was selected for the battery stack expansion limiter system based on its fire rating, Young's modulus, and dielectric strength. Additionally, Kapton tape was used on cell faces and edges as a secondary electrical insulating layer between cells and between high/low voltage systems. My responsibilities ranged from electrical design to CNC machining of battery stack end plates throughout this project.

<p>
Battery pack thermal management was considered for the acceleration, autocross, and endurance challenges. The acceleration event was short enough that cell thermal capacitance would prevent damage. Autocross was tricky due to the highly varying power draw profile. Previous autocross maps allowed for the generation of a simulant power draw profile that could be used in a transient thermal analysis. Air cooling through the pack, focusing flow towards the stack tops (near the cell tabs), was found to be adequate for previous autocross track layouts. Thermal design for the endurance event was simplified to a steady-state analysis at the 10C cell continuous current rating. The forced convection cooling design for the autocross event was also found to be sufficient for the endurance event.

<h2 id="high-voltage">High Voltage System</h2>

<p>
Over 30 pages of formula rules govern the vehicle's high voltage (HV) system, largely to enforce safety, I designed and implemented the precharge/discharge circuitry, high current contactors, fusing, disconnects, safety lighting, and galvanic isolation with ground fault detection for our HV system. A precharge circuit charged the motor controller capacitors at a controlled rate before connecting a high current path through the contactors. The discharge circuit removed charge from these same capacitors upon disabling the HV system in order to prevent driver/crew contact with HV. Two single pole, normally open Kilovac EV200 contactors were used in the high current path to isolate the battery from the motor controllers. A Littelfuse L50S200 allowed for up to 200&nbsp;A continuously, broke at 600&nbsp;A in 6&nbsp;s, and broke at 2000&nbsp;A in 3&nbsp;ms. With stack internal resistances on the order of 0.1&nbsp;m&ohm;, this fuse would have been more than accurate to mitigate a short circuit. Safety lighting was designed to run directly off of the HV system through a DC-DC step-down converter. A simpler solution would have used a voltage divider, but power losses of such a design were considered excessive. The formula also required galvanic isolation between the high and low voltage systems, along with ground fault detection between the two systems. Part of the HV circuit diagram is shown below for reference.

{% endwith %}

<p>
I designed a printed circuit board (PCB) to house the high voltage control circuitry in one convenient place. Board design with galvanically isolated HV and LV systems required a wide neutral zone spacing and a conformal coating. With this design, all HV components could be hard-mounted in the battery box in one location, which eased packaging, circuit debugging, and battery/controller interfaces.

<p>
The motor and motor controller were selected in parallel with battery pack design. The Emrax 207 Medium permanent magnet AC motor had a high power/weight ratio, high efficiency, and small packaging. Other induction, DC brushed, and brushless motors were considered, but none neared the performance of the Emrax motors, which were originally designed for electric propeller aircraft. Voltage, current, angular position, and angular velocity feedbacks were necessary to drive the motors with a three phase inverter using a direct torque control drive algorithm. The Bamocar D3 400-400 inverter met voltage/current requirements for the motor with built-in regenerative braking capabilities. Two separate inverters were required to drive two motors, one for each rear wheel. Water cooling was required for the inverters and motors, which was provided through a water pump, and heat was rejected through a centrally mounted radiator with air ducting around the driver's head.
</p>


<h2 id="low-voltage">Low Voltage System</h2>

<p>
The low voltage (LV) system interfaced with the driver through the dashboard, brakes, and accelerator. It processed these signals into inputs for the motor controller and safety lighting. The LV system measured spring, brake pedal, and accelerator pedal travel via linear potentiometers, tire temperature from infrared sensors, vehicle acceleration through an inertial measurement system, and video from an HD camera. Pertinent data was transferred to race engineers in real-time through an onboard Wifi signal. I led a group of four mechanical and electrical engineers that worked on the LV system. It was a team effort to design, fabricate, and install this system which interfaced with every other part of the vehicle.
</p>

<p>
A Beaglebone Black microcontroller running Linux was used to control the vehicle. It could interface with an SD card for storage, USB for the HD camera, analog inputs for the potentiometers, as well as digital I/O for the infrared sensors and inertial measurement system. On top of all of that, it could broadcast a Wifi signal for interfacing with race engineers in real-time. I wrote the control code in Python with an object oriented structure to organize the driver, powertrain, sensor, and engineer interfaces.

<p>
Safety was of the utmost importance and the formula strictly defined a LV safety interlock system which all LV current had to pass through. Emergeny stop switches were required in several places around the vehicle, a brake overtravel switch would trigger in case of brake hydraulics failure, and a ground fault detection could directly turn off all LV current through a relay. The ground fault detector was provided by a competition sponsor, and I designed a LV relay board to condense most of the safety interlock system into one location. A startup buzzer and safety lighting were also required, and ran directly off of current passing through the safety interlock system.

<h2 id="team">The Team</h2>


<div class="row">
<div class="col-xl-6">
<p>
Bulldogs Racing was a multiyear team effort involving undergraduates, graduates, faculty, race volunteers, and sponsors. Taha (President), Dante (Project Manager), and I led the charge spending countless hours drumming up support, designing the car, and fabricating in the garage. Claire and Tyler rounded out the Bulldogs Racing leadership team with immeasurable contributions to engineering and financing. The next generation of students were the heart and soul of this team: Anton, Aydin, Betsy, Bryan, Craig, Eli, Holden, Jordan, Josh, Kai, Kate, Laila, Miles, Patrick, Rijan, Sida, Tilman, and Yossi. In hindsight, I wish that I had focused more on team building than vehicle building, but it was a pleasure working with each and every student on the team. I also can't thank the previous generation enough: Alex, Chinmay, Connor, Riley, and Shivang. This project would not have been possible without two Joes, one PhD student and one faculty member, both of whom kept our team running in more ways than one. Max, Ngoc, and Sana helped us fabricate components through Yale's CEID. And Nick was the driving force supporting our machining needs, with tough words of wisdom that every undergraduate needs! A final thank you goes to Dean Wilczynski, who championed our cause within Yale's School of Engineering and Applied Science.
