    Formula SAE is an international competition where student teams design, fabricate, and race cars to a set of rules called the formula. Bulldogs Racing is Yale University's chapter of Formula SAE, which has competed in some form of the competition since 2007. During my first year with the team we competed at the Formula SAE Hybrid competition, taking 3rd place in 2014. We converted to an all-electric team for my last year and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
    From 2015-2016 I was Chief Engineer of the team, during which time I led design and fabrication of the battery box, high voltage, and low voltage systems of the vehicle. I also led the high-level powertrain system design including motor, inverter, and battery cell selection. These systems largely defined the vehicle acceleration and endurance performance.

<h2>Powertrain</h2>

<p>
A system-level design of the vehicle's powertrain required strict adherence to the formula and performance-price trade-offs between commercial-off-the-shelf battery cells, motor inverters, and motors. Many commercial electric vehicles use DC-DC converters to step-up low battery pack voltages, thus reducing I<sup>2</sup>R losses. This practice decreases the number of cells in series and mitigates battery pack energy losses due to cell mismatch and degradation. However, the formula stipulated a maximum tractive system voltage of 300&nbsp;V, which was low enough for me to rule out DC-DC conversion early on in the design process. The formula also restricted maximum power output to 80&nbsp;kW and energy storage to 5.4&nbsp;kWh with an 80% cell derating, which influenced motor and cell selection respectively. The high power-to-weight ratio of electric motors enabled an independent rear wheel drive design with two Emrax 207 motors delivering up to 160&nbsp;Nm at 320&nbsp;A each. Driving the rear wheels with separate motors precluded the need for a differential and chain/gear drive while also reducing axle lengths. The motors were selected to complement a 300&nbsp;V tractive system voltage and 4:1 planetary gearboxes matched the Emrax 207 speed/torque outputs to those necessary for Formula SAE acceleration and autocross events.

<p>
Formula SAE has three dynamic events: acceleration, autocross, and endurance. The design described thus far was optimized for acceleration and autocross, while still offering adequate endurance performance. Rear tire coefficient of friction, weight balance, and pitch axis were used to calculate a peak acceleration of 1.3g. The motors and batteries were sized large enough to burn out the rear wheels at speeds up to 40&nbsp;mph. Prediction for straight-line 0-60&nbsp;mph were 2.09&nbsp;s and the powertrain was sized for a maximum speed of 90&nbsp;mph, which was high enough to cover peak acceleration event speeds with some safety factor.
</p>


<h2>Battery Box</h2>

<p>
Battery cell selection was performed in parallel with motor and motor controller selection. The formula limited bus voltage to 300&nbsp;V, power output to 80&nbsp;kW, and battery energy to 5.4&nbsp;kWh. Several cylindrical, prismatic, and pouch cell systems were traded based largely on performance, complexity, and cost. Lithium cobalt oxide cells had the best specific energies, but there were serious concerns about cell puncture and thermal runaway safety at the time, especially given that this was a student team operating at a university. The lithium iron phosphate chemistry offered higher specific power and safety at the cost of specific energy. Power-energy requirements for the competition's dynamic events encouraged my decision to use a lithium iron phosphate chemistry, which also took into account safety concerns. Note that most commercial electric vehicles have power-energy requirements that prefer high specific energy, thus pointing towards a lithium cobalt oxide chemistry, or more recently a lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide chemistry. Additionally, puncture and thermal runaway safety performance for these chemistries have been greatly improved throughout the late 2010s.
</p>

<p>
A123 Systems, a spin-off of MIT, was the premier provider of lithium iron phosphate battery cells at the time. Their AMP20 pouch cell with a 3.3&nbsp;V nominal voltage, 19.5&nbsp;Ah capacity, 10C continuous current rating, and 22C peak (for 10&nbsp;s) current rating was perfectly sized for our vehicle. The high cell capacity meant that all cells could be placed in series, thus circumventing individual cell string fusing requirements in the formula. I designed a battery box with 86 of these cells in two stacks of 21 cells and two stacks of 22 cells to limit voltages for assembly and handling. Formula rules limited battery segments to maximums of 15&nbsp;kg, 120&nbsp;V, and 1.67&nbsp;kWh. The theoretical maximum voltage of the battery (with 3.6&nbsp;V max per cell) was 310&nbsp;V, but charging was limited to 300&nbsp;V to follow the formula and allow for cell inhomogeneities. Overall, the battery pack could supply high enough currents to nearly saturate the two Emrax 207 motors while still allowing for high speed operation at a peak voltage near 300&nbsp;V.

<p>
The formula specified additional rules for the use of lithium ion cells in the battery pack. At least 30% of cells were required to be monitored by the battery management system (BMS) for both voltage and temperature. Due to the large cell size and limited number of cells, I designed the BMS to monitor all 86 cell voltages and temperatures. Distributed cell boards were placed between the tabs of each cell and a two wire protocol was used to communicate between cell boards and the centralized BMS controller, an eLithion Lithiumate Pro. The cell board location had two benefits: easy access to positive and negative terminals as well as optimal placement for temperature monitoring, since cell tabs have limited areas (high current density) with high internal resistances. The BMS was sophisticated enough to prevent overcharging, overdischarging, and overheating while estimating battery pack voltage and energy in real-time.
</p>

<p>
The formula also had rules for pouch-style cells with laminated aluminum casings that expanded and contracted during operation. To prevent the cells from delaminating, an expansion limiter pressed the cells together, face-to-face, with a nearly constant pressure throughout the cells' operating life. A123 suggested containing the cells at between 0.3 and 1.2&nbsp;bar with cycle life peaking at a cell pressure of 0.8&nbsp;bar. A polyurethane filler, aluminum end plates, and steel threaded rods plimited cell expansion to meet this requirement. As the cells expanded, the filler was compressed, thus reducing the pressure rise. Aluminum end plates transmitted the threaded rod tension evenly across the cell faces, as verified by finite element analysis.

<p>
Cells were individually tested for capacity and internal resistance via a custom testing circuit that could operate at currents of 0.5C or 1C (10&nbsp;A or 20&nbsp;A). A Beaglebone Black controlled the circuit by relay in an automated test cycle based on cell voltage. Current was measured via a 0.005&nbsp;&ohm; shunt resistor. After all cells were measured, they were distributed between battery stacks based on measured cell capacity. In this manner the stacks could be individually charged before the endurance event to maximize total battery charge. The battery box could also be charged as a whole at the cost of less total charge. Multiple cells were rejected due to significantly lower capacity, thus proving that individual cell testing was worthwhile.
</p>

<p>
The formula had strict guidelines for materials used within the battery box, all of which had to be UL&nbsp;94&nbsp;V-0 rated (or equivalent). Stratasys RGD525 plastic material was used to 3D print battery stack tab covers on an Objet30 Pro. Specimens of this material were also printed to carry out testing for dielectric strength (ASTM D149 IEC 60243) and fire resistance (UL&nbsp;94&nbsp;V-0). Rogers Corporation PORON&reg; foam was selected for the battery stack expansion limiter system based on its fire rating, Young's modulus, and dielectric strength. Additionally, Kapton tape was used on cell faces and edges as a secondary electrical insulating layer between cells and between high/low voltage systems. My responsibilities ranged from electrical design to CNC machining of battery stack end plates throughout this project!
